**Alper Yazar**

{:.text-align-center}
*["Full Stack Electronics"]({% post_url 2023-09-09-full-stack-elektronik %}) Engineer*

I earned my BSc and MSc degrees from the same department,
[METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) EEE, in 2012 and 2015, respectively. My
master's thesis focused on statistical signal processing. As a PhD candidate, I
worked on FPGA-accelerated cloud computing.

At work, I mainly focus on FPGAs and embedded systems. I also have experience in
analog/digital circuit design and PCB design.

I've been passionate about electronics and computers since I was 10. I enjoy
working on projects, reading blogs, exploring code, watching technical videos,
attending courses and webinars, publishing papers, and engaging in other geeky
activities. I'm a big supporter of free and open-source projects üêß.

Besides technology, I also love music and musical instruments üéµ.

## Work Experience

- Present - 2012, **Electronics Engineer / ASELSAN**, Ankara Turkey. Most of
  the time I design embedded things (like bare metal programming, RTOS,
  embedded Linux) + FPGAs (mostly Xilinx products). Previously, also worked on
  board design (schematic and layout). [Company web

- 2021 - 2018, **Project co-manager + Design Engineer / ACCLOUD Project**.
  [ACCLOUD](http://accloud.eee.metu.edu.tr/) was a research project on FPGA
  accelerated cloud computing. The work was supported by
  [TUBITAK](https://www.tubitak.gov.tr/en) and
  [ASELSAN](https://www.aselsan.com.tr/en). I was one of the two project
  managers and responsible for architecture design + FPGA implementation
  (operational at 40 Gbps line rate).
- 2011, **Intern / ASELSAN**, Ankara, Turkey. [Company web
