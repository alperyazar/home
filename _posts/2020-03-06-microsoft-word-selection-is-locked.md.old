For some **stupid** reason, you may be required to write a **stupid** Word
document by editing a **stupid** `.dotx` template. Even you are *supposed to
change* some part of the **stupid** template, you may get the following
**stupid** error:

`You can't make this change because this selection is locked.`

There are several proposed solution for this **stupid** problem but only one
of them worked for me. [^1]

1. If your Word is missing `Developer` tab at the top, first go to `Options` â†’
    `Customize Ribbon`. and enable the `Developer` option.

2. Then click `Design Mode` to remove the **stupid** restriction.

3. Thank LaTeX developers.
