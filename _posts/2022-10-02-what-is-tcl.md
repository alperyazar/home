Tcl (pronounced *tickle* but there is no harm in pronouncing *t c l*) is a
programming language created by [John
Ousterhout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ousterhout) in **1988**. He was
working on [EDA
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation)(Electronic Design
Automation) tools and created the language for this kind of tools. Name of the
language aligns with its purpose: **T** stands for **Tool**, **C** is for
**Command** and **L** is for **Language**. Although each letter represents a
word, the preferred name of the language is Tcl **not TCL**, only T is capital
(but again, there is no harm in writing TCL).

Today, Tcl is still #1 scripting/command language for
[EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) tools like
[Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) from
[Xilinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xilinx).

Tcl continues to improve. It is **alive**, it is **open source**, it is a
**simple language**. It is **cross platform** and it can be used on almost all
operating systems including macOS, Microsoft Windows and Linux.
